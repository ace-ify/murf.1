Day 3 of the Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge done!

Just built a wellness companion that does daily check-ins through voice. You talk to it about your mood, energy level, and what you want to get done today. It actually remembers your previous conversations too.

What it does:
- Asks how you're feeling and what your energy is like
- Helps you think through 1-3 goals for the day  
- Gives simple suggestions (nothing medical, just supportive)
- Saves everything to a JSON file so it remembers next time

Built with Murf Falcon (seriously the fastest TTS I've used), LiveKit Agents, and Gemini. The voice responses are super quick which makes the conversation feel natural.

The coolest part is when you connect again later, it references your last check-in. Like "last time you mentioned low energy, how's today?" It's pretty neat.

I'm doing this as part of the Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge - building 10 voice agents in 10 days.
